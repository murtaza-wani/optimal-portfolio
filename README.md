# 📊 Optimal Portfolio via Monte Carlo Simulation

This project is a Jupyter Notebook-based analysis that uses **Monte Carlo simulations** to determine the **optimal investment portfolio** — the one with the **highest Sharpe Ratio**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

We simulate thousands of random portfolio weight combinations across a selection of assets, calculating each portfolio's **expected return**, **volatility**, and **Sharpe Ratio**. The portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio is considered the optimal one, balancing risk and return most effectively.
